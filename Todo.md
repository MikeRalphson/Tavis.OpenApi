# ToDo List

## Approach
- Never throw an exception, just add to the errors collection, and try and keep going
- Load components first, or JIT load referenced items
## Organization
- Move parse field dictionaries out of model classes
- Move errors collection to parsing context object 
## Missing features
- parse V2 OpenAPI
## Nice to have
- Add extension parses
